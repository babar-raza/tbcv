# Test Article for Workflow

This is a test article to verify that batch validation workflows now work correctly with real-time progress updates.

## Features Being Tested

- Workflow execution (no longer stuck in PENDING)
- Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- Live event broadcasting
- Progress bar animation

## Expected Results

When this article is validated in a batch workflow:
1. Workflow should transition from PENDING to RUNNING
2. Progress should update in real-time
3. WebSocket should broadcast updates
4. Dashboard should show live progress

Let's see if it works!
