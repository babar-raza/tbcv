# ============================================================================

I need you to implement the TBCV validator architecture migration autonomously, from start to finish, without waiting for me to say "continue" or "keep going" between phases.

## Context

This is a production codebase at: c:\Users\prora\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\tbcv

The codebase has a comprehensive migration plan already created. You need to implement it systematically and completely.

## Your Mission

**Implement the complete validator architecture migration** following the phased approach documented in the plans/ directory.

**Key Points**:
1. **Work autonomously** - Don't stop between phases waiting for approval
2. **Follow the plan exactly** - It's in plans/START_HERE.md
3. **Test everything** - Run tests after each validator implementation
4. **Document progress** - Create MIGRATION_LOG.md and update as you go
5. **Handle errors** - If test fails, fix and retry up to 3 times before moving on
6. **Make reasonable decisions** - If something is unclear, make best judgment and document

## Entry Point Document

**READ THIS FIRST**: `plans/START_HERE.md`

This document contains:
- Implementation order (strict sequence to follow)
- All phases broken down step-by-step
- Code template locations
- Testing procedures
- Success criteria
- Progress tracking template

## Implementation Order (from START_HERE.md)

1. **Phase 0** : Feature flags & test framework
2. **Phase 1** (CRITICAL): BaseValidatorAgent, SeoValidatorAgent, ValidatorRouter
3. **Phase 2** (CORE): Implement 6 remaining validators (YAML, Markdown, Code, Links, Structure, Truth)
4. **Phase 3** (TESTING): Parity tests, integration tests, load tests, UI updates
5. **Phase 4** (DEPLOYMENT PREP): Config updates, documentation
6. **Phase 5** (OPTIONAL if not deploying): Gradual rollout
7. **Phase 6** (OPTIONAL): Cleanup

## Code Templates

**All code is ready in**: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_NEW_AGENTS.md`

Copy these implementations exactly:
- BaseValidatorAgent (complete)
- SeoValidatorAgent (complete)
- YamlValidatorAgent (use as template for others)

## Rules for Autonomous Operation

1. **Run tests after each validator**: `python -m pytest tests/validators/test_{name}_validator.py -v`
2. **Commit after each phase**: Use meaningful commit messages
3. **Track progress**: Update MIGRATION_LOG.md after each phase
4. **Handle errors autonomously**:
   - If test fails: analyze, fix, retry (up to 3 times)
   - If import fails: check paths, create missing files
   - If unclear: make reasonable assumption, document in code comment
5. **Don't skip steps**: Follow sequence in START_HERE.md exactly
6. **Create completion report**: When done, create MIGRATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md

## Success Criteria

By the end, verify:
- [ ] All 8 validators implemented and registered
- [ ] All tests passing (>90% coverage)
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:8000/api/validators/available` shows 10 validators
- [ ] UI dynamically loads validators
- [ ] Fuzzy detector enabled and working
- [ ] No regressions in existing functionality

## What I Expect

**Do this autonomously without my intervention**:
1. Read plans/START_HERE.md completely
2. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_NEW_AGENTS.md for code templates
3. Create MIGRATION_LOG.md to track progress
4. Implement Phase 1 completely (Foundation)
5. Implement Phase 2 completely (Core Validators)
6. Implement Phase 3 completely (Testing & Integration)
7. Implement Phase 4 (Config & Docs)
8. Create MIGRATION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
9. Summarize what was done

**Output as you go**:
- Show which phase you're working on
- Show test results after each validator
- Show any issues encountered and how you resolved them
- Show progress updates

**Only stop if**:
- Critical error that can't be auto-resolved (database corruption, etc.)
- All phases completed successfully

## Additional Context

**Current State**:
- ContentValidatorAgent is monolithic (2100 lines, does 10 validations)
- UI is missing 3 validators (SEO, heading sizes, LLM)
- fuzzy_detector is disabled in config
- No extensibility framework for future validators

**Target State**:
- 8 modular validator agents (200-300 lines each)
- All validators accessible from UI
- fuzzy_detector enabled
- Easy to add new validators (gist analyzer, etc.)

**Priority Features**:
- Backward compatibility (old system still works)
- Zero downtime
- Easy rollback (feature flags)
- Extensible (can add gist analyzer in 4-8 hours)

## Start Now

Begin by reading `plans/START_HERE.md` and start implementing.

Work autonomously through all phases. Show your progress as you go.

You have full autonomy to make decisions and keep going. Don't wait for me between steps.

Good luck! 🚀
