# TBCV System Announcement

## Key Features

### Human-in-the-Loop Workflow with Smart Auto-Fix

The TBCV system is designed for **human-in-the-loop** workflows with intelligent automation:

- **Auto-fixable issues** → Can be applied in bulk or with one click
  - System knows exactly what's wrong, where it is, and how to fix it
  - Examples: Missing plugin mentions, formatting issues with clear solutions
  - Safe for automated application without breaking content meaning

- **Non-auto-fixable issues** → Require human review and manual editing
  - Ambiguous cases that need human judgment
  - Examples: Potential typos, context-dependent corrections
  - Prevents the system from making potentially incorrect automated changes

This distinction ensures content quality while maximizing automation efficiency. The system accelerates your workflow by automating what it can safely fix, while flagging issues that genuinely need your expertise.
